# Next-Word-Prediction-Using-LSTM-and-GRU
The objective of this project is to implement and compare the performance of LSTM and GRU models for next word prediction. The text data from 'Hamlet' is preprocessed, tokenized, and used to train both models. Streamlit applications are developed for user interaction, allowing users to input a sequence of words and get the predicted next word.
